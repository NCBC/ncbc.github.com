title: UNC Badminton raises over $1k for Seymour Center
---

Back in October, UNC Badminton hosted their 2012 Fun Badminton Event. In addition to providing an enjoyable round-robin competition for the community, UNC Badminton had the goal of raising money for the Robert and Pearl Seymour Center, which serves seniors in Chapel Hill. Thanks to the impressive turnout at the event, UNC Badminton reports that they were able to donate over $1,000 to the Seymour Center! Congrats to the UNC Badminton Club for hosting the event and helping out the community!
