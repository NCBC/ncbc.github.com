title: Volunteers needed for badminton clinics in Apex
---

As mentioned on our [Community](http://ncbadminton.org/community/) page, NCBC is running two badminton clinics in Apex on September 30 and October 7. To help make everything run smoothly, we'll need some volunteers. We're looking for individuals willing to introduce new players to basic badminton techniques, including how to do stretches, how to hold and use a racket, and basic footwork/court movement. There will also be 3-5 minute demonstration games every hour.
