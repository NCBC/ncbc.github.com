title: "Sport2Sport location adds Tuesday play"
---

Starting May 7, our Sport2Sport location will add Tuesday evenings to its lineup. Hours will be from 5:00 PM - 9:00 PM. Please note that the $8 per person drop-in costs will apply, even if you have a Sport2Sport membership (the facility has decided that the memberships will only apply to play on weekends). For the latest information and schedule updates on all of the region's badminton facilities, visit the [Locations](http://ncbadminton.org/locations) page.
