title: "Another big tournament win for Triangle junior"
---

North Carolina's own Soumya Gade continues to be a competitive force at the national level. 

The Triangle junior recently traveled to Parsippany, New Jersey for the Mid-Atlantic Classic, a national ranking tournament. Through several exciting matches, Souyma and her partner Milind Dake outperformed the competition to win the Mixed Doubles bracket. Soumya also placed 2nd in Women's Doubles (teaming up with Deepti Reddy), and reached the semifinals in Women's Singles.

Congratulations to Soumya for her latest achievements, and thanks as always to our community members for their coaching, training, and support.
