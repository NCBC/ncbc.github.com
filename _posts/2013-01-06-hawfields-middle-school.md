title: Hawfields Middle School gets new gear thanks to USBEF and Yonex
---

Pictures of happy students from Hawfields Middle School were [recently featured on the front page of USA Badminton](http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Badminton/Features/2013/January/04/The-Spirit-of-Giving.aspx). The reason? Yonex and the USA Badminton Education Foundation (USBEF) teamed up to give students a much-needed gift of new badminton equipment!

> Before going home for the holidays, Hawfields Middle School students were pleasantly surprised by receiving a wonderful gift from USAB and Yonex.  As teachers Lisa J. Ward and BJ Condron talked to students about the ‘spirit of giving’ and the holiday season, three boxes wrapped as presents for the Physical Education Department were revealed.  Students listened intently and began to anticipate what might be in the boxes.  The packages were unwrapped by three school Badminton Club members in front of approximately 75 wide-eyed students.   Everyone cheered wildly as boxes were opened containing sixty Yonex rackets and 12 tubes of nylon shuttles. […]

> The gift of the new equipment began with a request to the United States Badminton Education Foundation (USBEF) for assistance to replace 10+ year old rackets for Physical Education instruction at a middle school in the heart of the Atlantic Coast Conference where BADMINTON IS AS POPULAR AS BASKETBALL.  The sport is so popular in the area that a local high school (that these students feed into) has recently painted lines for three courts due to student requests to play badminton!

Our sincere thanks go out to Yonex, USAB, and USBEF for their generous gift, and to NCBC board member Lisa Ward for continuing to develop badminton programming for students in North Carolina!
