The North Carolina Badminton Club (NCBC) is a nonprofit serving the greater Triangle area (Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill). Our mission is to promote the development of badminton as a recreational and competitive sport in North Carolina. To this end, NCBC provides information about where to play, coordinates training opportunities for players of all ages, and organizes competitive events.
